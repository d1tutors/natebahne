              I'm a passionate creator and problem solver who loves bringing ideas to life through 
              technology, design, and hands-on building. Whether it's designing board games, competing 
              in engineering competitions, or developing innovative projects, I'm always exploring new 
              ways to create meaningful experiences.

              My work spans multiple disciplines, from game design and 3D printing to web development 
              and competitive engineering. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and push the 
              boundaries of what's possible.
